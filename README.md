# POLI-783-Labs
Simple package for POLI 783

The package containes function part_of_kernel ()

This is the result of my final project for POLI 783 Lab classes. *part_of_kernel ()* covers instructions from weeks 1-4 and uses Rcpp extension. The function has 3 arguments: two vectors and a constant.

See for more details as it should be: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_basis_function_kernel
